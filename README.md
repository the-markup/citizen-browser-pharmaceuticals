This repository contains data underlying the findings of our story, "[How Big Pharma Finds Sick Users on Facebook](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/)," from our series, [Citizen Browser](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/).

Our methodology is described in "[How We Built a Facebook Inspector](https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/how-we-built-a-facebook-inspector)."
